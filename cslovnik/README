Simple program for translation.
Currently only one foreign language is supported (CZ <-> EN).
The data file is modified version of this GNU/FDL dictionary: http://slovnik.zcu.cz/
New version is under development.
Features:
- uses posix mmap to speed up search - <3 ms per search on c2d
- optimized for multiple searches
- uses rather universal data format (slightly modified version of regular GNU/FDL dictionaries)

In order to compile and run use cmake, make and conv.sh:
cmake .
make
./conv.sh
./src/slovnik
